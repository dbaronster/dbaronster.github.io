  	  <img src="./images/PORTFOLIO PROJECTS_AWS - MODULE 2_THUMBNAIL.png" alt="Solution Architecture." width="640" height="360"/>
  	  <p>In this project based on a real-world scenario, I acted as Cloud Specialist with the mission to migrate users in an automated way and manage AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) resources.</p>

  	  <p>There were 100 users that needed to be migrated and have MFA (Multi-fa	ctor authentication) enabled on their accounts, as this is a security best practice.</p>

  	  <p>To avoid repetitive and error prone manual tasks in the AWS console, I looked for the best way to automate the processes.</p>

  	  <img src="./images/PORTFOLIO PROJECTS_AWS - MODULE 2_ARCHITECTURE.png" alt="Solution Architecture." width="640" height="360"/>
  	  
  	  <p>I cleaned up a .csv file containing an exported list of users, mapping positions to various groups that I had created in IAM.</p>
  	  <p>I then ran a shell script using the AWS CLI to automatically create those users and add them to their respective groups.</p>
  	  <p>Users were assigned fixed passwords that they would have to change on initial login.</p>
  	  <p>All groups were configured to require MFA to gain access to their services.</p>
  	  
  	  <img src="./images/PORTFOLIO PROJECTS_AWS - MODULE 2_IAM_USERS.png" alt="Solution Architecture." width="640" height="360"/>
  	  <p>The script worked beautifully, creating the hundred users very quickly and easily.</p>

  	  <p>In another project based in a real-world scenario, I acted as the Cloud Specialist responsible for migrating a workload running in a Corporate DataCenter to AWS.</p>

	  <p>The application and database were migrated to AWS using the Lift & Shift (rehost) model, moving both application and database data.</p> 

	  <p>I followed some migration steps: Planning (sizing, prerequisites, resource naming), Execution (resource provisioning, best practices), Go-live (validation test - 
		 Dry-run, final migration - Cutover) and Post Go-live (ensure the operation of the application and user access).</p>

  	  <img src="./images/PORTFOLIO PROJECTS_AWS - MODULE 3_ARCHITECTURE.png" alt="Solution Architecture." width="640" height="360"/>
  	  
  	  <p>I have to admit, this lift and shift included a Django web app served by a python app, neither of which I could write or even debug myself. </p>
	  <p>I guess that's as it should be - migration to the cloud shouldn't require expertise on the applications or content!</p>
  	  <p>Similarly, the database dump, imported to the AWS RDS, was strictly black box for this exercise, validating the table structure and population only.</p>
  	  
  	  <img src="./images/PORTFOLIO PROJECTS_AWS - MODULE 3_WikiArticles.png" alt="Wiki Articles." width="640" height="360"/>
  	  <p>The Wiki worked perfectly, creating and updating articles as designed.</p>

  	  <p>In this project based on a real-world scenario, I was responsible for implementing an application that needs to support the high demand of a large number of users accessing it simultaneously.</p>

	  <p>This application has been used in a large conference that had more than 10,000 people, in-person and online, with participants from all over the world. The event was broadcast online and in 
		person and 10 vouchers were drawn for 3 Cloud certifications. At that moment, more than 10,000 people in the audience registered their e-mails to guarantee their participation in the raffle.</p>

	  <p>We used in AWS, Elastic Beanstalk services to deploy the web application, DynamoDB to store emails, CloudFront to cache static and dynamic files in an Edge Location close to the user.
		Load was simulated with <code>stress -c 4</code></p>

  	  <p>In this project based on a real-world scenario, I acted as DevSecOps Engineer, and I deployed a set of EC2 instances and infrastructure in an automated way using Terraform (infrastructure as code - IaC). Also, it was necessary to install a specific security agent on all these instances in an automated way.</p>

	  <p>Once the infrastructure was provisioned, AWS System Manager and its component Command Run were used to install the security agents in an automated way.
		 I used the Amazon Simple Notification Service – SNS to send an email informing the whole process status.  Receipt of that email was a reassuring confirmation of process completion.</p>

  	  <p>In this project based on a real-world scenario, I acted as a Cloud Architect and created an executive presentation of infrastructure costs for a SAP migration project from On-Premises to AWS.</p>

	  <p>SAP workloads were running in a corporate DataCenter with the environment divided into Production, Quality Assurance - QA and Development/Test layers.</p>
	  <p>My mission was to estimate the costs of migration to AWS, considering that this infrastructure will be running on AWS for at least the next 3 years.</p>
	  <p>I used the AWS Pricing Calculator to build an estimate, mapping services from a spreadsheet containing the onprem hardware, storage and load capacity.
		AWS services needed to meet or exceed requirements includeds ECS instances, Application Load Balancers, Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), Amazon RDS Oracle instances, and an AWS Support Plan.</p>
