		  <p> When I first moved to Austin in 2002, looking for work, I joined a Toastmasters club as a "networking opportunity"...</p>

		  <p>I soon discovered that the program is not only a lot of fun, but is more enriching and challenging that I ever imagined.</p>

		  <p>While it may be have been the networking opportunity I was looking for, I appreciate the skills Toastmasters delivered both on the job and in the job search.</p>

		  <p>My home club, Lake Travis Toastmasters, disolved last year, as did many other clubs struggling post pandemic.
			 I still recommend the program to anyone looking to improve their commniocation skills in a dynamic, supportive setting.
		  I was also a member of Launch Pad Toastmasters, and a corporate club at Dun & Bradstreet.</p>

        <h2 class="text-primary-hero">Bio</h2>																				
			<p> I've moved around quite a bit. Landed in Houston at the beginning of High School. Then moved 
			to Wilton, CT my senior year. That year back in the North East was enough to convince me that
			the Ivy League wasn't where I wanted to spend the next four years, so I turned down MIT, 
			Princeton and Stanford, and chose <a href="http://explore.rice.edu/explore/Default.asp">Rice University</a> over all others. It was a good choice, one I've
			never second guessed. It was a fine learning experience, great teachers and programs.</p>
			<p> A couple of years after graduation I was working at a UNIX office automation firm, Handle 
			Technologies, when I decided it would be really cool to do Mac softare for a living and started 
			poring through MacWorld and MacUser magazines, looking for hot products. I was particularly attracted to
			ThinkTank 512, a very slick outline processor that succeeded ThinkTank 128, one of the first Mac products 
			to catch my eye. When I contacted Living Videotext, they were interested, but could not hire someone with 
			zero Mac programming experience. So... I picked up my trusty Inside Macintosh, phonebook addition, and 
			MegaMax C, and got working with my HyperDrive. I wrote a programmer's editor, using TextEdit with some
			assembly patches to handle tabs; wrote one of the first Windows menus with command-key equivalents, Tile and 
			Overlay; and invented a Synchonized Scrolling feature that was emulated in Mac programmer's editors that 
			followed later. (It appears in BBEdit to this day.) I licensed the Editor to MegaMax for inclusion in their product,
			after adding the syntax reference feature at their suggestion.</p>
			<p> The Editor landed me that job at Living Videotext, where I soon became the lead developer of MORE, 
			which integrated outlining with Presentation technolgies ("Bullet Charts" and "Tree Charts"). I played a huge 
			role in morphing ThinkTank 512, with its PC-port UI, into MORE, sporting a clean, Mac stadard UI with a polished
			look and feel that helped it earn user enthusiam and MacUser's Product of the Year.</p>
			<p> When the VP Engineering Peter Winer left the company, I took over as Engineering Manager, leading the MORE 
			team in the development of <a href="http://www.outliners.com/more30">MORE 3</a>. My mission was clear: enhance but <em>simplify</em>. I held the
			line and built the best version of MORE yet, correcting some of the excesses from MORE II, adding new features
			while making great strides in ease of use. MORE 3 still runs under Mac OS 9.x today.<span style="font-size:9pt">
			(To read another view of the history of ThinkTank and MORE, see Dave Winer's <a href="http://davewiner.userland.com/outlinersProgramming">Outliners & Programming</a> page.)</p>
			<p> I left Symantec to get back into startup mode with Dave Winer's next venture, UserLand Software. There, I was the lead programmer 
			of <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">UserLand Frontier</a>, the first system-level scripting system 
			for the Macintosh. Unfortunately, Apple had their own plans for scripting, so we needed to cross platforms 
			to find a market. Ultimately, it was the Internet that needed scripting most, and 
			Frontier found its best role as an Internet Application Development platform. UserLand's <a href="http://manila.userland.com">Manila</a> 
			and <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio</a> are built in Frontier.</p>
			<p> After UserLand, I consulted for several years, then continued the startup path with Corio ("the first ASP"),
			then Webalo (a tiny startup making a wireless play). Though these ventures, I developed my Java skills more 
			deeply, including JSP, servlets, and Swing. I also worked with XML, DTD, XSLT, and VoiceXML (fun!).</p>
			<p><em> More to come...</em>
