<p><a href="#">Hear Fado from Passionada!</a></p>

<p>Fado music is the heart of the Portuguese soul. It is arguably the oldest urban folk music in the world. Some say it came as dance from Africa in the 19th century and was adopted by the poor on the streets of Lisbon. Or perhaps it started at sea as the sad, melodic songs coaxed from the rolling waves by homesick sailors and fishermen. </p>

<p><em><b>Whatever it's origins its themes have remained constant: destiny, betrayal in love, death and despair</b></em>.  A typical lyric goes: &ldquo;Why did you leave me, where did you go? I walk the streets looking at every place we were together, except you're not there.&rdquo; It's a sad music and a fado performance is not successful if an audience is not moved to tears.  </p>

<p>By the early twentieth century, fado had become a fixture in the everyday life of Lisbon's working class. It was played for pleasure but also to relieve the pain of life. Skilled singers known as fadistas performed at the end of the day and long into the night. Fado was the earthy music of taverns and brothels and street corners in Alfama and Mouraria, the old poor sections of Lisbon. (Another strain of fado, Coimbra fado, was favored among university students and professors.) </p>

<p>Many believe the Golden Age of fado was the second quarter of the twentieth century when Portuguese dictator Antonio Salazar forced the fado performers to become professional and confined them to sing in the fado houses and in so called &ldquo;revistas,&rdquo; popular revues similar to vaudeville.</p>

<p>From the 1940's until her death in 1999, the towering figure of Portuguese fado was Amalia Rodrigues. She was the diva of fado, worshipped at home and celebrated abroad as the most famous representative of Portuguese culture. When she died the country's prime minister called for three-days of national mourning. Such is the hold of fado over the people of Portugal.</p>

<p>The essential element of fado music is &ldquo;saudade,&rdquo; a Portuguese word that translates roughly as longing, or nostalgia for unrealized dreams. Fado flowers from this fatalistic world-view. It speaks of an undefined yearning that can't be satisfied. For Portuguese Americans fado is an expression of homesickness for the place they left behind.</p>

<p>Like other forms of folk music such as American blues, Argentine tango or Greek rebitika, fado cannot be explained; it must be felt and experienced. One must have the soul to transmit that feeling; a fadista who does not possess saudade is thought of as inauthentic.  <em><b>Audiences are very knowledgeable and very demanding. If they do not feel the fadista is up to form they will stop a performance</b></em>.</p>

<p>Fado can be performed by men or women, although many aficionados prefer the raw emotion of the female fadista. Dressed in black with a shawl draped over her shoulders, a fadista stands in front of the musicians and communicates through gesture and facial expressions. The hands move, the body is stationary. When it's done correctly, it's a solemn and majestic performance.</p>

<p>The traditional accompaniment for the fadista is a Portuguese guitar, or guitarra, a 12-stringed instrument, and a bass guitar, or viola. Sometimes a second acoustic guitar is added. In recent years, fado recordings have added piano, and violin and accordion, instruments which sometimes accompany the music on the streets of Lisbon.</p>

<p>Today the younger generation in Portugal and America is respectful but not dedicated to fado. In PASSIONADA, the generation gap between mother and daughter is typified by their different taste in music; Celia is an old-school fadista, her daughter listens to rap on her Walkman.</p>

<p><em><b>But in the last decade, a new generation of young musicians have contributed to the social and political revival of fado music, adapting and blending it with new trends</b></em>. Contemporary fado musicians like Misia have introduced the music to performers such as Sting. Misia and fadistas like Cristina Branco walk the fine line between carrying on the tradition and trying to bring in a new audience.</p>

<p>Sofia Milos, who plays the fado-singing Celia in PASSIONADA, is half Greek and half Italian, but she instinctively understood the hot-blooded emotions of the music. She was coached by Ana Vinagre, a Portuguese-American who is one of the most popular and accomplished fado singers in the Northeast. She studied Vinagre's gestures and body language, as well as her passionate presentation, and incorporated that into her performance.</p>

<p>The actual vocal tracks in PASSIONADA are performed by Misia, perhaps Portugal's reigning fado deity. Two songs from her acclaimed 1999 CD, &ldquo;Paixoes Diagonais&rdquo; (&ldquo;Diagonal Passions&rdquo;) are used in the film. One number, &ldquo;Triste Sina,&rdquo; a song made famous by Amalia Rodrigues, is about a woman's regrets for the things she's done wrong. The title translates roughly as the sadness within, which sums up the spirit of fado.</p>
