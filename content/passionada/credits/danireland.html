<p>Dan Ireland has the Midas touch when it comes to casting.  His first discovery was Renee Zellweger 
whom he directed in THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD(1996).  His second discovery was Salma Hayek whom he directed in THE VELOCITY OF LARRY.  And now, Emmy Rossum is the third woman to begin a meteoric rise after being directed by Dan. Emmy has recently been chosen to star as Christine in the film version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.
</p>
<p>Dan executive produced Ken Russell's LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM (1988), THE RAINBOW (1989)  and MIDNIGHT CROSSING (1988) with Faye Dunaway.. He is currently prepping his next project THE LEGACY, based on the novel by Guy de Maupassant. Dan, born in Vancouver B.C., was the co-founder of the Seattle International Film Festival.
