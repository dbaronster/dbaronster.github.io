<h3><a name="who">Who are you... ?</a></h3>
<p>I'm Doug Baron, a 16-year Silicon Valley veteran who loves to build software
-- and is exceptionally good at it.&nbsp; I'm a fast learner and have taught
myself countless skills along the way to producing outstanding, end-user
production code, both at small companies and as an independent consultant.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3><a name="what">What are you looking for?</a></h3>
<p>I'm looking for a full time work in Austin, with a company devoted to 
developing Internet applications that they are excited about. </p>
<p>I'm capable of leading new product planning, design, implementation
and delivery, but am ready to take on whatever role would be most effective 
for the company.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3><a name="expert">What's you expertise?</a></h3>
<p>Broadly speaking, I'm a strong Internet infrastructure and application
developer. Under Windows NT, I can write C++ applications, build SQL databases, configure IIS, and
design and develop JavaScript ASP pages for interaction and presentation. Under
Unix (or any Java-enabled platform), I can do the same thing with Jave, Apache,
JSP and EJB.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3><a name="skills">What other skills do you have?</a></h3>
<p>My Java coding skills are very strong, as is my C and C++. I hand code all of
my HTML/CSS but know how to compose active pages (ASP, JSP) that can be edited
by non-technical writers using tools like DreamWeaver or GoLive. With SQL, I
know how to do joins and other intermediate-level operations, and know how to
address basic performance concerns.</p>
<p>Other Web composition systems I'm familiar with include ATG Dynamo (jhtml)
and UserLand Frontier / Manila.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3><a name="experience">What kind of experience do you have?</a></h3>
<p>My work in the Valley began in the summer of 1985 with Living Videotext (LVT),
makers of ThinkTank. I was Lead Developer of MORE for the Macintosh, the
successor to ThinkTank 512. After LVT's merger with Symantec and the release of
MORE 3.0 (which I managed), I joined UserLand Software, developing
Frontier, the first system level scripting system for the Macintosh.</p>
<p>In recent years I have worked at internet startups Corio, Inc. and Webalo,
Inc., developing Internet infrastructure and applications in Java, working in
Unix environments (Sun Solaris and RedHat Linux), using source code control
systems CVS and Visual SourceSafe. In between startups, I've worked as an
independent consultant, developing Web applications in the Windows environment
(2000 Advanced Server) using Microsoft SQL Server, JavaScript, ASP and Cold
Fusion.</p>
<p>My full experience is detailed in my <a href="../resume.html">resume</a>.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>

<h3><a name="recent">What did you do most recently?</a></h3>
<p>April though September of last year I worked at Webalo, Inc., a very
small startup in the wireless arena, developing an internet service platform in
Java. In the process, I learned XSLT and VXML, both of which are pretty cool and
fun; I'd love to do more work with them. At Webalo, I also became more expert at
the Swing libraries.</p>
<p>November '01 through February of this year, I worked with UserLand Software 
on the Frontier platform and on a new product that has not been announced.</p>

<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3><a name="end">What happened there?</a></h3>
<p>Last year, the principals of Webalo decided that the next round of financing 
was not imminent, and had to cut costs down to the bare minimum and eliminate 
my position as Architect.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, UserLand similarly faced a cash crunch are was forced 
to drop the new product that I was working on. Times are tough!</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3><a name="best">What's the best thing you've done?</a></h3>
<p>Well, it's hard to pick one thing. I really enjoyed and am still proud of the
work I did on MORE, which ended up on the desktop of thousands of users who
gave it rave reviews. Frontier also had a great fan club, and interacting with
those users online and working their feedback into subsequent releases was
gratifying.</p>
<p>Must of the Web work I've done of late has been interesting, challenging and
fun, including the Cold Fusion application prototype I built for NearSpace, and
the server management portal I developed for FocusEngine. I look forward to
harnessing the web and reaching more people with the applications I develop in
the future.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3><a name="now">What do you want to do now?</a></h3>
<p>As alluded to in the response above, I'd like to build cool, useful web
applications that add to the productivity of a large group of people, either
individually or by building connections between them. I would enjoy developing a
voice interface to any such application, and whatever management tools would
complement its deployment and maintenance.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3><a name="company">What kind of company do you want to work with?</a></h3>
<p>My experience has been mainly with smaller companies, but a larger company
with a small company culture would be great too. The real concern is that the
project I'm working on be important to the company and its success. I'd like to
have the opportunity to distinguish myself based on the fruits of my labor,
whether it's the design of a user interface or the timely delivery of a solid
product.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3><a name="where">Where do you want to work?</a></h3>
<p>I'm moving to Austin and am looking exclusively for employment opportunities
based in that area.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3><a name="salary">What salary do you expect?</a></h3>
<p>My salary history is high, but at this time I'm completely open to discussing
any offer that meets the market. My responsibilities and compensation can 
increase after I've established myself with the company.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3><a name="sample">Do you have any examples of your work?</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the work I did at Webalo is strictly confidential, and the
application I developed at Corio was for internal use. But if you can look at 
<a href="http://www.userland.com">UserLand</a>
Software's products, Frontier, Manila and Radio; they are all built on the
foundation I co-developed in the '90s. Information on MORE can be found on 
<a href="http://www.outliners.com/more30">Outliners.com</a></p>
<p>I'm also in the early stages of developing a calendar management application
for <a href="http://www.acterra.org">Acterra</a>, an environmental support
organization. The original, static calendar site is at <a href="http://www.ecocalendar.org/jan/january.html">ecocalendar.org</a>.
It was updated using a completley manual process. The live site that I am developing hasn't had much time invested in it yet, but is functional at a rudimentary
level.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3><a name="hire">Why should we hire <em>you</em>?</a></h3>
<p>The reasons are many:<ul>
<li>I'm a self-starter, requiring minimal ramp-up time on most projects</li>
<li>I know how to manage my time effectively</li>
<li>I'm a good writer and communicator</li>
<li>I can help keep the team on track as deadlines approach</li>
<li>I can contribute more to the effort than is planned or expected</li>
<li>I'm fun to work with</li>
</ul>
