<p><b>&ldquo;PASSIONADA&rdquo; SET TO PREMIERE IN NEW BEDFORD, MA</b></p>

<p>Samuel Goldwyn Films is proud to announce the premiere of PASSIONADA, a new film directed by Dan Ireland. The premiere will take place in the town of New Bedford, MA on August 4 at 7:30pm with PASSIONADA&rsquo;s stars Sofia Milos, Jason Isaacs and Emmy Rossum scheduled to attend.

<p>David Bakalar, President & Producer, Sandyo Productions said, &ldquo;PASSIONADA is a heart warming film. It&rsquo;s about hope - about a family of three generations of women overcoming the problems of their past and moving on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>Set against the picturesque backdrop of New Bedford, PASSIONADA is a wonderful and winning romance centered on a Portuguese-American family where old traditions conflict with modern views.  The family is headed by a beautiful and talented Fado singer (Sofia Milos), who is also a single mother, juggling life with her willful teenage daughter (Emmy Rossum) and her meddling mother-in-law (Lupe Ontiveros).  She has everything under control until a sexy wandering stranger (Jason Isaacs) falls in love with her, forcing Sofia to decide if the wrong man just might be the right one. </p>

<p>The film stars Isaacs (HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, PETER PAN), Milos (&ldquo;The Sopranos&rdquo;), Rossum (Roland Emmerich&rsquo;s TOMORROW, Clint Eastwood&rsquo;s MYSTIC RIVER), Theresa Russell (BLACK WIDOW), Seymour Cassel (THE ROYAL TANNENBAUMS), and Ontiveros (REAL WOMEN HAVE CURVES).  It was written by Jim & Steve Jermanok with a musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams (SHREK).  Jim Jermanok also served as Executive Producer.
